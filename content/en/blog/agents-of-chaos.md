Despite appearances, this is not a documentary about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. I would call it a revealing of the cards, showing the truth about the Russian invasion and the reasons for the war in Ukraine first in 2014 and then in 2022. It is worth noting the activities of the Russian troll farm - the IRA (Internet Research Agency), for which Ukraine was a test battlefield in cyberspace. Less and more sophisticated methods used by the Internet Research Agency were shown.
