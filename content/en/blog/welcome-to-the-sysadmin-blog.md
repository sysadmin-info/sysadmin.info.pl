Hi, 

What follows is history. More than 3 years have passed since then. Is that a lot or a little? For me it has changed a lot, as I managed to move to the third line at Fujitsu and worked more than a year in the Linux team and then moved to Research and Development, where I now work as Quality Assurance, but basically my work is still related to Linux, only that I now work with SLES and open SUSE. At home, I currently have a Raspberry Pi 4b rev 1.4 with 8 GB RAM and a 120 GB SSD, on which Debian 11, Home Assistant Supervised and a couple of other things are installed, and a Fujitsu Esprimo Q920 with 16 GB RAM and a 512 GB SSD, on which I have Proxmox with virtual machines such as a multi-node Wazuh cluster though, and Portainer, which I use to quickly put up Docker containers. I've managed to get through installing the system on several VPS I've purchased. I've set up a mail server on Postfix as well as Dovecot, Dovecot Sieve, Postgrey, SpamAssassin, ClamAV, etc. I also installed Apache and Nginx, which I then secured, so called hardening. I learned about OpenvSwitch, Qemu KVM, Proxmox, ESXi, Zabbix, Zephyr Enterprise, Jenkins, Selenium Grid, Confluence, Jira and many other tools and solutions. I have gone through the management of old machines such as Solaris, SCO_SV, old CentOS and Red Hat (versions 4, 5, 6, 7). I've learned a lot of things and I'm still learning. I am not standing still. I'm developing the Technology Stack. I'm learning AWS and how to configure environments that are already more advanced in terms of security. I don't program, although writing code in Java, Python, Bash, C is not a problem for me. It's just that programming is not my passion. My passion is Linux and the extensive security associated with it. OSINT, although I know it, is not something I do either, because it's not a challenge for me and it's not my role to seek people out over the Internet. If someone has more knowledge than me, but does not respect me, is not cultured and hides behind an illness, which I have personally encountered, in addition, shows elementary deficiencies in reading with understanding, is a dinosaur and presses SELinux or AppArmor to beginners, this person has nothing to look for here. Netiquette such a person should have learned at the very beginning, because it is the basis of the Internet. Let's respect each other, because this is the way to professionalism. Plus the ability to control one's own emotions, and the quote of Master Yoda "Do or do not, there is no try" - is the road to success. 

Old post from September 2019:

This blog will focus on Linux server administration. I will focus on popular distributions such as Debian 9.8.0, CentOS 7.6, Fedora 29. Of course, I won't stop there, as I still have a RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) 7.7 instance on the Virtual Box. 

I'll describe the solutions I've implemented at home on three laptops that act as servers at home for self-study purposes. In addition, I bought myself a VPS, on which I set up an environment for myself to host this very site. I also intend to buy another VPS in the future and move the installation of the mail server and Samba to one machine. Ultimately, I want to shut down the other two laptops (mail server and Samba), hide them in a drawer and have everything online.
