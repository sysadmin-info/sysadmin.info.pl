##### Setting Up MQTT Communication:

1. Install MQTT add-on in Home Assistant.
2. Configure MQTT integration in Home Assistant.
3. Create a user for the MQTT add-on (MQTT broker) in Home Assistant.

eg. ```mqtt-user``` 

4. Add user for the MQTT on Ulanzi TC001 Smart Pixel Clock  in the Auth section.
5. Prepare a simple payload for communication with the Ulanzi device in MQTT Mosquito addon.

```json
{
	"text": "Hello, Sysadmin!",
	"icon": "1",
	"rainbow": true,
	"duration": 10
}
```
6. Click publish and check that the text is visible on Ulanzi TC001 Smart Pixel Clock. Unfortunatelly this is not a permanent solution.
