In the next few weeks, I intend to publish my own training courses entirely in Polish related to RHCSA. Yes, free of charge, because these are the basics of any Linux distribution in principle and in my opinion it is ridiculously simple. The exam requires you to understand and remember the commands by heart, so it&#8217;s not that simple anymore, because the commands come in as time goes by when you tap them every day with your finger.

The price of the exam itself is about 1800 PLN. No, I do not have this exam, I intend to do it one day, when I decide that I know almost everything by heart, and in case of emergency I will use the helpa and mana. The bottom line is to know how to do a given thing correctly.

This training will cover the basic scope, i.e. system installation, user management, firewall and so on. These are the basics of basics. I know that there are a lot of such tutorials on the web. But when I hear English performed by Indians, I&#8217;m damned, and in turn Americans or British can speak too quickly. 

The episodes will be videos that I&#8217;ll upload to youtube as soon as possible. It won&#8217;t be a staggering pace, but I&#8217;ll try to post at least one per week on my blog.
